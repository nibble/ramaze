  module Helper
    # Helper module for handling file uploads. File uploads are mostly handled
    # by Rack, but this helper adds some conveniance methods for handling
    # and saving the uploaded files.
    module UploadHelper
      include Innate::Traited
      # Assume that no files have been uploaded by default
      trait :default_uploaded_files => {}.freeze

      # This method will iterate through all request parameters
      # and convert those parameters which represents uploaded
      # files to Ramaze::UploadedFile object. The matched parameters
      # will then be removed from the request parameter hash.
      #
      # If +pattern+ is given, only those request parameters which
      # has a name matching +pattern+ will be considered.
      #
      # Use this method if you want to decide whether to handle file uploads
      # in your action at runtime. For automatic handling, use
      # Ramaze::Helper::UploadHelper::ClassMethods::handle_uploads_for or
      # Ramaze::Helper::UploadHelper::ClassMethods::handle_all_uploads instead
      #
      # Regardless if you choose to use manual or automatic handling of file
      # uploads, both single and array parameters are supported. If you give
      # your file upload fields the same name (for instance upload[]) Rack will
      # merge them into a single parameter. The upload helper will keep this
      # structure so that whenever Rack uses an array, the uploaded_files
      # method will also return (a hash) of arrays.

        #
        # [:allow_overwrite] If set to *true*, uploaded files are allowed to
        #                    overwrite existing ones. This option is set to
        #                    *false* by default
        # [:autosave] If set to *true*, Ramaze::UploadedFile.save will be called
        #             on all matched file uploads automatically. You can use
        #             this option to automatically save files at a preset
        #             location, but please note that you will need to set the
        #             :default_upload_dir (and possibly :allow_overwrite)
        #             options as well in order for this to work correctly.
        #             This option is set to *false* by default.
        # [:default_upload_dir] If set to a string (representing a path in the
        #                       file system) this option will allow you to save
        #                       uploaded files without specifying a path. If you
        #                       intend to call Ramaze::UploadedFile.save with a
        #                       path you don't need to set this option at all.
        #                       If you need to delay the calculation of the
        #                       directory, you can also set this option to a
        #                       proc. The proc should accept zero arguments and
        #                       return a string. This comes in handy when you
        #                       want to use different directory paths for
        #                       different users etc. This option is set to *nil*
        #                       by default.
        # [:unlink_tempfile] If set to *true*, this option will automatically
        #                    unlink the tempory file created by Rack immediatly
        #                    after Ramaze::UploadedFile.save is done saving the
        #                    uploaded file. This is probably not needed in most
        #                    cases, but if you don't want to expose your
        #                    uploaded files in a shared tempdir longer than
        #                    necessary this option might be for you. This option
        #                    is set to *false* by default.
